# OTT Platform with AWS üé•üåê

This project is aimed at developing an Over-the-Top (OTT) platform leveraging various Amazon Web Services (AWS) to provide a scalable, reliable, and secure streaming solution for multimedia content.

## Requirements üõ†Ô∏è

- **Apache Server**: Ensure Apache server is installed and configured properly to host the backend of the application.
- **Visual Studio or Sublime Text**: Use any code editor such as Visual Studio or Sublime Text for writing and editing code.
- **PHP**: Make sure PHP is installed on your system to support server-side scripting for dynamic web pages.
- **AWS Account**: You'll need an AWS account to utilize various AWS services such as Amazon S3, AWS Lambda, and AWS Cognito.
- **XAMPP**: Install XAMPP to control and manage the Apache server along with other necessary components like MySQL.
- **Database (phpMyAdmin)**: Set up a MySQL database using phpMyAdmin for storing user data, content metadata, and other related information.

## Setup ‚öôÔ∏è

1. **Prerequisites**: 
   - Install XAMPP and start the Apache server and MySQL database.
   - Set up an AWS account and configure AWS CLI with appropriate credentials.
   - Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. **Configuration**:
   - Configure the Apache server to serve the backend PHP files from the project directory.
   - Update the configuration files with your AWS credentials and other necessary settings.

3. **Deployment**:
   - Deploy the backend services using XAMPP or manually configure Apache to run PHP scripts.
   - Set up AWS services such as S3 for content storage, Lambda for serverless functions, and Cognito for user authentication.

4. **Testing**:
   - Test the application by accessing it through the browser and ensuring all functionalities work as expected.
   - Test user authentication, content streaming, and database interactions to validate the system's functionality.

## Usage üìù

1. **Sign Up / Sign In**:
   - Users can sign up for a new account or sign in using their existing credentials through the provided authentication interface powered by AWS Cognito.

2. **Browse Content**:
   - Explore the available multimedia content categorized by genre, popularity, release date, etc.

3. **Watch Content**:
   - Stream videos seamlessly on different devices with adaptive bitrate streaming support facilitated by AWS services.

4. **Subscription**:
   - Subscribe to premium content with flexible subscription plans and payment options.

5. **Analytics**:
   - Monitor platform usage, user engagement, and revenue metrics through the analytics dashboard powered by AWS CloudWatch or other analytics tools.

## Procedure üõ†Ô∏è

1. **Install XAMPP**: 
   - Download and install XAMPP from the official website.
   - Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

2. **Start XAMPP Server**:
   - Launch XAMPP Control Panel.
   - Start the Apache server by clicking on the "Start" button next to it.

3. **Copy Files to htdocs**:
   - Navigate to the XAMPP installation directory, typically located in the C: drive.
   - Find the `htdocs` folder.
   - Copy or extract all project files into the `htdocs` folder.

4. **Access Localhost**:
   - Open your web browser.
   - Enter `http://localhost` or `http://127.0.0.1` in the address bar.

5. **View Web Application**:
   - Your project should now be accessible through the localhost address.
   - If you have a specific page you want to appear as the homepage, mention its name in the URL, for example: `http://localhost/index.php` or `http://127.0.0.1/home.html`.

6. **Interact with the Application**:
   - Test the functionality of your application by interacting with it through the browser.
   - Ensure all features are working as expected.

7. **Further Customization**:
   - Customize the project files according to your requirements.
   - Modify the Apache server configuration if necessary.

8. **Development and Testing**:
   - Continue development and testing of your application locally.

9. **Deployment**:
   - Once the application is ready for production, consider deploying it to a live server for public access.

10. **Documentation**:
    - Document any configurations or customizations made for future reference.

## Troubleshooting Tips ‚ÑπÔ∏è

- If you encounter any issues with Apache or accessing the localhost, check the XAMPP documentation or community forums for troubleshooting tips.
- Ensure proper file permissions for the project files within the `htdocs` directory.
- Check for any conflicts with other services running on the same port.

## Note üìù

- Remember to stop the Apache server when not in use to conserve system resources and ensure security.
- Regularly update XAMPP and your project dependencies to maintain stability and security.
